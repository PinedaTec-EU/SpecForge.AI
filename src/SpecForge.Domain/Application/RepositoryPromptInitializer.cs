        # SpecForge Agent Instructions

        These instructions apply to SpecForge workflow artifacts stored under `.specs/`.

        ## Workflow Access

        - Use the SpecForge MCP as the operational source of truth for user story workflow state, current phase, pending questions, approvals, and workflow actions.
        - Before answering or resolving blocked refinement, spec, approval, or workflow questions, inspect the user story through MCP tools such as `get_user_story_workflow`, `get_current_phase`, `get_user_story_summary`, and `list_user_story_files`.
        - Submit workflow answers and decisions through MCP tools such as `submit_refinement_answers`, `submit_approval_answer`, or the closest available workflow operation.
        - Do not modify `.specs/**` workflow artifacts directly when an MCP tool exposes the corresponding workflow action.
        - Direct reads of `.specs/**` files are allowed for evidence, debugging, and technical inspection, but they must not replace MCP workflow state when both are available.
        - If the MCP is unavailable or does not expose the required information or action, state that limitation explicitly before relying on direct file inspection or manual edits.

        ## User Story Quality

        - Prefer complete, precise, implementation-ready user stories. The more explicit the actor, goal, trigger, business rules, inputs, outputs, constraints, edge cases, and acceptance intent are, the better optimized the story is for the SpecForge workflow.
        - Do not compress important business or technical context just to make the story shorter. Preserve facts that can reduce refinement loops, approval questions, design ambiguity, review failures, or later rewinds.
        - If the user gives an incomplete story, use the MCP workflow to surface or answer questions instead of silently inventing business-critical facts.

        ## Goal Intake And /goals

        - When the user invokes `/goals` or gives one broad product goal, treat it as goal intake, not as permission to implement the whole system directly.
        - If SpecForge MCP tools are available, decompose the goal into small, ordered, independently reviewable user stories and persist them through `specforge_action` with action `create_user_stories_from_goal`.
        - Do not modify product code from a broad `/goals` prompt before at least one resulting user story has moved through the required SpecForge SDD gates.
        - Each generated story must preserve traceability to the original goal, include acceptance intent when known, and be narrow enough to complete through the canonical workflow without mixing unrelated features.
        - After creating stories from a goal, recommend the first story to run and continue through MCP workflow tools one story at a time.

        ## Questions And Decisions

        - Questions can appear in multiple workflow phases, including refinement, spec approval, review, release approval, and reopened workflows.
        - Always inspect the current workflow details before assuming where the blocking questions live: refinement questions are exposed through `refinement.items`; approval and later decision questions are exposed through `approvalQuestions` or phase artifacts surfaced by the MCP.
        - When answering on behalf of the user, keep answers grounded in user-provided intent or repository evidence. If the evidence is insufficient, report that the question still needs direct user input.

        ## Audit Attribution

        - When the model performs a workflow action requested by the user, pass an `actor` value that makes the indirect action explicit, for example `model-on-behalf-of-user`, unless the user provides a more specific actor.
        - Do not present model-mediated approvals, rejections, overrides, rewinds, regressions, resets, reopens, or submitted answers as direct user actions.
        - Include concise reasons when tools accept them, especially for `request_regression`, `rewind_workflow`, `restart_user_story_from_source`, `approve_review_anyway`, and `reopen_completed_workflow`.

        ## Reopening Completed Workflows

        - A completed user story can be reopened through `reopen_completed_workflow` when a real defect, merge conflict, functional issue, or technical issue is discovered after completion.
        - Use the supported `reasonKind` values exposed by the MCP tool contract, and include a concrete `description` of what failed or what must be incorporated.
        - After reopening, re-query `get_user_story_workflow` and continue from the reopened phase through MCP instead of editing artifacts directly.

        - make the implementation artifact auditable for the next phase by naming the repository evidence, touched files, and validations that actually happened
