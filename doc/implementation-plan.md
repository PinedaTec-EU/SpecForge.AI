# SpecForge · Implementation Plan

## Proposed Sequence

### ✅ Step 1. Lock the canonical workflow

Deliverables:

- ✅ initial phases
- ✅ input and output contracts per phase
- ✅ mandatory checkpoints
- ✅ regression criteria
- ✅ artifact versioning rules
- ✅ practical source immutability rule once `spec` starts
- ✅ work-branch creation timing

### ✅ Step 2. Define minimum persistence

Deliverables:

- ✅ `doc/` folder structure and runtime state persisted in the repo
- ✅ `state.yaml` format
- ✅ `branch.yaml` format
- ✅ timeline or event format
- ✅ essential markdown templates
- ✅ cross-phase input inference rule to avoid redundant `input.md`

### ✅ Step 3. Design the initial MCP contract

Deliverables:

- ✅ `create_us_from_chat`
- ✅ `import_us_from_markdown`
- ✅ `list_user_stories`
- ✅ `get_user_story_summary`
- ✅ `get_current_phase`
- ✅ `get_user_story_runtime_status`
- ✅ `generate_next_phase`
- ✅ `approve_phase`
- ✅ `request_regression`
- ✅ `restart_user_story_from_source`
- ✅ `list_user_story_files`
- ✅ `add_user_story_files`
- ✅ `set_user_story_file_kind`
- ✅ branch creation integrated into `approve_phase`

### ✅ Step 4. Implement the workflow engine core

Deliverables:

- ✅ domain model
- ✅ transition validation
- ✅ local persistence
- ✅ domain tests

### ✅ Step 5. Add a minimum VS Code extension

Deliverables:

- ✅ user-story view
- ✅ create/import command
- ✅ continue-phase command
- ✅ primary-artifact opening

Notes:

- the minimum extension already exists and compiles
- the automation core already exists through a workflow runner
- `continue phase` in the extension still needed wiring to that runner or to the final MCP backend

### ✅ Step 5.1. Wire the extension to the local workflow runner

Deliverables:

- ✅ invoke `WorkflowRunner` from extension commands
- ✅ make `continue phase` execute a real workflow advance
- ✅ refresh the tree after state and artifact changes
- ✅ open the generated artifact when applicable

### ✅ Step 5.2. Introduce a stable application/MCP layer

Deliverables:

- ✅ define a stable boundary between extension and backend
- ✅ encapsulate `WorkflowRunner` behind application services
- ✅ align real operations with `mcp-contract-fase-1.md`
- ✅ prepare replacement of the local runner with an MCP backend without breaking the UI

### ✅ Step 5.3. Replace placeholder generation with real phase execution

Deliverables:

- ✅ replace example artifacts with execution based on previous artifacts and workflow rules
- ✅ persist real phase results
- ✅ record failures, blocks, and regressions in timeline and state
- ✅ maintain traceability between artifacts and decisions

### ✅ Step 5.4. Enrich the minimum UX

Deliverables:

- ✅ selected-phase detail
- ✅ contextual actions per phase
- ✅ clear feedback for errors and blocks
- ✅ minimum base for a future workflow graph view

## Recommended Order After This User Story

1. ✅ define the canonical phase-1 workflow
2. ✅ define the real `doc/` structure and runtime artifacts
3. ✅ define the minimum MCP contract
4. ✅ start domain and persistence implementation
5. ✅ lock branch naming strategy and safe user-story restart
6. ✅ introduce the real MCP backend behind the current boundary
7. ✅ enrich phase execution with real providers/agents
8. ✅ embed versioned prompts and materialize `.specs/prompts/` overrides lazily
9. ✅ keep `.specs/config.yaml` initialization independent from prompt execution
10. ✅ run real phase execution with embedded prompts when disk overrides are absent
11. ✅ compose effective per-phase prompts from disk override or embedded template using runtime context
12. ✅ expose `request_regression` end to end in domain, MCP, and extension
13. ✅ implement safe restart from source
14. ✅ close the baseline branch-naming strategy for phase 1
15. ✅ introduce explicit user-story category with a configurable repo catalog
16. ✅ group the VS Code explorer by user-story category
17. ✅ introduce a minimum TypeScript test project for the extension
18. ✅ extend UX with graph view and richer phase detail
19. [ ] complete a richer prompt editor/inspector from the extension
20. [ ] enrich branch lifecycle with real Git/PR integration
21. [ ] introduce SpecForge Central managed-repository catalog and repository selection

## Risks To Watch

- overdesigning workflows before validating the base flow
- introducing too many domain entities too early
- mixing human state, technical state, and prompts without clear boundaries
- making the extension too smart and the backend too weak

## Deferred Decisions

- full visual workflow editing
- intra-user-story parallel slicing
- real PR integration
- real issue integration
- advanced multi-provider strategies

## Current State

Phase 5 is resolved at its minimum scope:

1. the extension already invokes the local backend
2. a stable boundary exists between UI and backend
3. phase execution already generates real artifacts derived from state
4. the minimum UX already offers detail, contextual actions, and basic feedback

The next leap is not more base infrastructure. The minimum MCP backend, OpenAI-compatible provider, repo-versioned prompts, CLI workflow portal, graph view, refinement hardening, and packaged MCP plugin artifacts are already operational. What remains to reach a stronger product MVP is to close the external-integration gaps and turn the workflow evidence into something easy to review, export, and trust.

## MVP Roadmap

Last reviewed: 2026-05-09, against implementation through `0.1.4.432`.

Goal:

- deliver a functional MVP to execute a sequential SDD workflow inside VS Code with persisted state, human checkpoints, and an interoperable local backend

Included in the MVP:

- ✅ user-story creation and import
- ✅ linear phase advance with approval where required
- ✅ local persistence in `.specs/`
- ✅ minimum MCP backend
- ✅ embedded prompts with lazy repo overrides and OpenAI-compatible provider
- ✅ explicit phase regression from UI and backend
- ✅ safe restart of a user story from source
- ✅ explicit branch naming by `kind` with `<kind>/us-xxxx-short-slug`
- ✅ explicit user-story category with a configurable catalog from `.specs/config.yaml`
- ✅ coherent operational roadmap between `doc/` and `README`
- ✅ minimum TypeScript test project for pure extension logic
- ✅ primary workflow view opened from the explorer with per-phase detail and visible audit
- ✅ extension settings for provider, connection, and watcher
- ✅ visible warning in the extension when the active provider is not configured, with a direct link to settings
- ✅ optional watcher with attention notifications and `play/pause/stop` controls
- ✅ extension sidebar with a single empty-state CTA and embedded creation form
- ✅ optional guided wizard in the sidebar intake to capture minimum and recommended user-story information
- ✅ visible distinction in UI and documentation between automatic phases and user checkpoints
- ✅ compact action in the sidebar header to customize one prompt template or export all embedded prompts
- ✅ initial visibility focused on active user stories and workflows in the sidebar and main views
- ✅ access from workflow view to prompts associated with the selected phase
- ✅ separation between `context files` and `user story info` within a user story
- ✅ only `context files` are reused as model runtime context
- ✅ management of `context files` and `user story info` through MCP as well as through the extension
- ✅ local `context files` suggestions during `refinement` using heuristics and repo neighborhood
- ✅ extension feature flag to enable or disable those suggestions, enabled by default
- ✅ persisted runtime status per user story to detect long-running executions and block duplicate reentry
- ✅ separate `refinement.md` artifact to accumulate refinement questions and answers without mutating `us.md`
- ✅ per-user starring of a user story with disk persistence and auto-reopen when VS Code is reopened
- ✅ CLI workflow portal with graph view, phase selection, cached HTML rendering, and browser actions for continue, refinement answers, approval answers, and approval
- ✅ workflow portal auto-open before model-driven phase iteration when the workflow constellation is not already visible
- ✅ concrete intake gate and hardened refinement so broad goals are clarified before decomposing into buildable user stories
- ✅ configurable MVP rigor (`low`, `medium`, `high`) for refinement strictness
- ✅ MCP tool schemas constrained with enums and fail-fast argument validation
- ✅ packaged MCP plugin bundle with compiled webview assets and MCP server artifacts

Does not block the MVP:

- ✅ workflow graph view
- ✅ richer phase detail UI with graph visualization, audit, metrics, lineage, and selected-phase artifacts
- [ ] prompt diffing and visible effective prompt inspection/editing from the extension
- [ ] real PR/issues integration
- ✅ phase agent profiles with real repository permissions
- [ ] customizable workflows and advanced agent strategies
- [ ] show completed user stories through an explicit UI switch
- [ ] add search over user stories/workflows in the side view
- [ ] link with ticketing tools (Jira, etc.)

High-value additions worth considering:

- [ ] Definition-of-Ready dashboard for refinement: show which MVP dimensions are still missing, which questions block progress, and why the selected rigor level is not yet satisfied.
- [ ] PR evidence pack: generate a compact summary from timeline, artifacts, review verdict, validation evidence, and changed files for PR descriptions or release notes.
- [ ] Review findings workflow: turn failed review items into tracked remediation tasks with status, owner, and retry history instead of leaving them only in Markdown.
- [ ] Plugin packaging/release command: one command to compile TypeScript, publish MCP binaries, sync plugin artifacts, validate tests, and prepare a versioned distributable.
- [ ] Roadmap/changelog automation: derive candidate release notes and roadmap status from `done` commits, then ask for human approval before persisting docs.

- ✅ expose buttons to open the selected phase `execute` and `approve` prompts when they exist
- ✅ allow a user story to be marked as `starred` per user and automatically reopened in visual mode when the workspace is reopened
- ✅ suggest adding `context files` when a user story enters `refinement` because repo context is missing
- ✅ suggest `context files` candidates using local heuristics and file neighborhood
- ✅ expose persisted runtime status through MCP so a model can check whether a user story is still running

- ✅ add model-assisted approval answer suggestions from the workflow portal
- ✅ add CLI workflow portal actions so the browser view can drive workflow progression
- ✅ add graph cache busting and refreshed documentation screenshots
- ✅ harden goal intake and refinement before spec readiness
- ✅ configure MVP rigor and propagate it through settings, prompts, MCP, CLI, and OpenAI-compatible execution
- ✅ extract MCP stdio transport, MCP tool registry, CLI settings store, and workflow render cache for SRP and focused tests
- ✅ expand MCP/portal tests across happy path and edge cases
- ✅ add packaged SpecForge MCP plugin bundle and regenerate distribution artifacts
- ✅ create a consolidated changelog for the recent release range
- [ ] complete rich prompt inspection/editing from the extension with diff or visible effective prompt
