# SpecForge · `02-technical-design.md` template baseline

## Goal

Define the minimum technical design template that serves as the direct input to implementation.

## Principles

- it must be practical and executable
- it must identify real impact on components
- it must document alternatives, risks, and validation strategy
- it must not turn into an academic document

## Proposed Template

```md
# Technical Design · US-0001 · v01

## State
- State: `generated`
- Based on: `01-spec.md`

## Technical Summary
What solution is being proposed and why.

## Technical Objective
What must change in the system to satisfy the approved spec.

## Usage Notes

- if the phase is redone after a regression, a new version must be generated
- the output must enable implementation without reinterpreting basic functionality
- in phase 1 this artifact is derived from the approved spec and is not a mandatory human approval stop by default
