# SpecForge · `timeline.md` phase 1

## Goal

Define the `timeline.md` format as the human-readable chronological record of a user story lifecycle.

## Purpose

`timeline.md` does not replace `state.yaml`. Its role is to:

- leave an auditable and easy-to-read trail
- explain why the user story state changed
- record decisions, approvals, regressions, and interventions
- summarize relevant events without forcing inspection of multiple files

## Main Rule

`timeline.md` records facts and brief context.

It must not duplicate:

- the full current state from `state.yaml`
- full Git metadata from `branch.yaml`
- full contents of phase artifacts

It should reference those artifacts when needed.

## Location

```text
.specs/
  us/
    us.<us-id>/
      timeline.md
```

## Proposed Structure

```md
# Timeline · US-0001 · Create SDD foundation for SpecForge

## Summary

- Current status: `waiting_user`
- Current phase: `spec`
- Active branch: `not created`
- Last updated: `2026-04-18T10:30:00Z`

## Events

### 2026-04-18T09:00:00Z · `us_created`

- Actor: `system`
- Phase: `capture`
- Summary: The user story was created from chat and `us.md` and `state.yaml` were initialized.
- Artifacts:
  - `.specs/us/us.US-0001/us.md`
  - `.specs/us/us.US-0001/state.yaml`

### 2026-04-18T09:04:00Z · `phase_started`

- Actor: `system`
- Phase: `spec`
- Summary: Spec generation started.

### 2026-04-18T09:06:00Z · `phase_completed`

- Actor: `system`
- Phase: `spec`
- Summary: The spec baseline was generated with `red-team` evaluation and `blue-team` reconstruction.
- Execution:
  - provider: `openai-compatible`
  - model: `gpt-5.4`
  - profile: `planner`
  - skill: `.codex/skills/sdd-phase-agents/SKILL.md`
  - skill: `../ai-skills-shared/.shared-skills/skills/terraform/SKILL.md`
- Artifacts:
  - `.specs/us/us.US-0001/phases/01-spec.md`

### 2026-04-18T09:10:00Z · `phase_approved`

- Actor: `user`
- Phase: `spec`
- Summary: The user approved the spec baseline and chose `main` as the base branch.

### 2026-04-18T09:11:00Z · `branch_created`

- Actor: `system`
- Phase: `spec`
- Summary: The branch `feature/us-0001-specforge-foundation` was created.
- Artifacts:
  - `.specs/us/us.US-0001/branch.yaml`
```

## Sections

### Header

It must contain:

- `usId`
- the user story short title

### `Summary`

It should only reflect a quick view:

- current status
- current phase
- active branch or absence of a branch
- last-update timestamp

This section may be rewritten on each relevant change.

### `Events`

It must be append-only at the semantic level.

Each event is added at the end and represents a fact that already happened.

## Event Format

Each event must include:

- ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
- event code
- actor
- associated phase when applicable
- short summary

It may optionally include:

- reason
- evidence
- affected artifacts
- execution metadata for generated phases
- notes

### Execution Metadata

Generated phase events may include an `Execution` block.

Supported fields:

- `provider`
- `model`
- `profile`
- `endpoint`
- `runtime-version`
- repeated `skill` entries

Skill entries record the Codex skill, shared skill file, local skill file, AGENTS instruction file, or repository workflow skill file that the executing model reported using while it produced the phase artifact.

When `specForge.features.phaseSkillUsageReportingEnabled` is enabled, model-backed providers ask the model to append a `## Skills Used` section to the generated artifact. The runner extracts that section into repeated timeline `skill` entries so phase detail screens can show the reported skills as inspectable links.

If no skill applies, the model should report `none`; `none` is not persisted as a skill entry.

## Minimum Phase-1 Events

- `us_created`
- `phase_started`
- `phase_completed`
- `phase_approved`
- `phase_regressed`
- `artifact_operated`
- `review_passed`
- `review_failed`
- `source_hash_mismatch_detected`
- `branch_created`
- `us_blocked`
- `us_waiting_user`
- `us_restarted_from_source`
- `pr_preparation_requested`

## Writing Style

- short sentences
- factual language
- no long narrative
- do not copy artifact contents
- link by path when the detail lives in another file

## Update Rules

- create `timeline.md` during `capture`
- add one event for each relevant phase transition
- add one event for each approval, regression, or human intervention
- update `Summary` when global status, current phase, or active branch changes
- if an operation fails without changing state, only record an event if it adds audit value

## When Not To Record An Event

- internal rereads with no effect
- idempotent validations with no observable change
- low-level technical steps that do not change a human understanding of the flow

## Relationship With `state.yaml`

- `state.yaml` is the structured source of current state
- `timeline.md` is the readable source of operational history
- if they diverge, `state.yaml` wins

## Open Decisions

- whether the size of `Summary` should be limited
- whether repeated technical errors should be aggregated into a single entry
- whether an additional `events.yaml` will be needed later for finer analytics
